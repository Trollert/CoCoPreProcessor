#             Version 0.1.0:            #
#########################################

- fixed some stupid bugs, probably created 10 more with this


- added save function for word/number replacements

	- any word/number replacements done within the UI Listsboxes is now preserved for the specific report
	  even when encountering bugs etc.

	- previous changes will be applied when opening the same report and will not be displayed in the 
	  listboxes

	- to revert this, just delete the save_numbers.pkl/save_words.pkl within the report folder


- added user specific "allowed words" functionality

	- users can now add words from the listbox directly to their own dictionary, so that they're no longer
	  identified as wrong words

	- to do this just select an entry in the listbox and right click on it to display the popup

	- duplicates will be removed after generating the modified file

	- this list is saved in the user_words.txt file and is user specific

	- the allowed_words.txt will be continuously updated from github, so don't insert your entries in there


- added vertical merging functionality (§§)
	
	- it is now possible to set merging markers within tables in ABBYY to merge those tables before uploading
	
	- to do this the marker §§ needs to be set at the first position within the specific cells
		- this means, for the first subtable, you have to put §§ before any cell content in the rightmost
		  last cell in the table (123.234.234,00 --> §§123.234.234,00)
		- in the next "to merge" subtable the marker has to be set in the leftmost first cell of the table
			- if there are more tables to be merged you have to also set the end marker (as in the first 
			  subtable) within this table
		- in the last subtable you only set the start marker

- added picture renaming .png --> .jpg functionality
	
	- all .png picture-files (if present) are now renamed to .jpg and the link text is fitted within the html


- added fonds report processing BETA

	- this function is more specific than the other functions, in that it only applies the modifying checkboxes
	  when the heading "Vermögensaufstellung" is found within a paragraph

	- for now it is able to fix the annoying thousand separator space (" ") which is often not correctly 
	  recognized by ABBYY. So it only applies to reports that have the number format "123 123 121,12". The
	  number of decimal places is hereby preserved from the original and can be of variable length

	- the other displayed option "break fonds table" should only be used, when you need to break the header
	  and first column content down, as asked by the customer (or the sample)
		- this will only affect the table following the "Vermögensaufstellung" Heading, so be sure to use 
		  the "§§" merging function before using this function

	- multiple occurences of two or more dots (.........) are now deleted
